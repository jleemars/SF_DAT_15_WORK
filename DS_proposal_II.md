I am still in the process of collecting data, but Iâ€™ve uploaded the initial csv containing the top scoring data from a singles event for the Bowling Nationals tournament. 

There is more data that I will pull to add to the CSV that will give me more to analyze. Team scores and Doubles scores, as well as averages from leagues. 

The idea is that this will hopefully allow me to take a deeper dive into this data set and give me some insights into how people bowl at the tournament across 9 games.

The singles and doubles events are always completed one after the other in a 4 hour set. While the team event is another day in a 3 to 4 hour time slot.

There is also a chance that I can use historical data from past years to  do a comparison. Any model I create for any prediction can be used against the past data, and against the 2015 data.
